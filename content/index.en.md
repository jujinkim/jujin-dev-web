# Welcome
To those of you who have bothered to visit this site, I offer my sincere condolences and slight regret, but I'll try to welcome you in my own way.

# About This Site
This is a development blog. I mainly intend to share knowledge related to IT development, but since things in the world don't always go as planned, many non-development topics will likely be posted as well. In other words, while it is ostensibly a "development blog," I sometimes write about random thoughts or nonsense unrelated to development.
Instead of using a blog CMS or service, I'm sharing content by extending a note-taking app. Therefore, although I write posts like "How to do X," I plan to focus more on writing about concepts, much like a Wiki.

# Etc.
