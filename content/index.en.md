# Welcome
To those of you who went out of your way to visit this site, I offer my sincere condolences and shallow regrets, and I will try my best to welcome you.

# About This Site
This is a development blog. I primarily intend to share knowledge related to IT development, but since things in life don't always go as planned, many non-development related topics will also be posted. In other words, while it is ostensibly a "development blog," I also occasionally write about non-development thoughts/nonsense.
Instead of using a blog CMS or service, I'm sharing content by extending a note-taking app. Therefore, while I may write "how-to" articles, I plan to focus on writing about concepts, much like a wiki.

# Miscellaneous

Contact is mostly welcome. You can find my contact information on [GitHub](https://github.com/jujinkim) or [my main site](https://jujin.kim).
