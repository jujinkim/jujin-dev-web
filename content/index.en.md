# Welcome
This is my development blog. I might post things other than development as well.

# About This Site
Ostensibly, it's a "development blog," but I sometimes write about random thoughts/nonsense that aren't related to development.
Instead of using a blog CMS or service, this is a site that extends a note-taking app for sharing. Therefore, rather than "how-to" articles, I plan to write posts focusing on the concepts of things, like a Wiki site.

# Contact
You are always welcome. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jujinkim) or contact me through the contact information on [my main site](https://jujin.kim).

# Etc
This site can also be accessed at [juijn.dev].
