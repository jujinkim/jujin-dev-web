# Jujin's Development Hub

Welcome to my corner of the internet, where I share my thoughts, learnings, and explorations in the world of software engineering.

## About This Site

This site serves as my digital gardenâ€”a place where I document my journey as a developer. You'll find articles on a variety of topics, from web development and system design to programming languages and tools. My goal is to create a collection of high-quality, practical content that can be helpful to other developers.

## About Me

I'm Jujin Kim, a developer who primarily works with front-end technologies but is constantly challenging myself with full-stack development to stay at the forefront of IT.

I primarily use Kotlin and C#, and I actively leverage other languages with the help of AI. I have a greater interest in overall programming design and architecture rather than just coding, and I am deeply exploring ways to enhance development productivity using AI pair-coding and AI code agents.

## Main Interests

Here are a few topics I'm currently interested in and writing about:

- **Full-Stack Development:** Development experiences and best practices covering everything from front-end to back-end.
- **Programming and Architecture:** Design patterns, microservices, and system design for creating scalable and maintainable software.
- **AI-Powered Development:** Innovating development workflows using AI, including AI pair-coding and code agents.
- **Exploring Core Languages:** In-depth usage and analysis of the latest features in Kotlin and C#.

## Contact

I always welcome interactions with other developers. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jujinkim) or contact me through the information on [my main site](https://jujin.kim).
