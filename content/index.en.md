# Welcome
To those of you who have made the effort to visit this site, I offer my sincere condolences and shallow regrets, while also trying my best to welcome you.

# About This Site
This is a development blog. I primarily aim to share knowledge related to IT development, but since things in life don't always go as planned, many non-development topics will also be posted. In other words, while it is ostensibly a "development blog," I also occasionally write down my thoughts and nonsense that are not related to development.
Instead of using a blog CMS or service, I am extending a note-taking app to share content. Therefore, while I will write "how-to" articles, I plan to focus on writing about the concepts of things whenever possible, much like a Wiki site.

# Etc.
