# Welcome
To those of you who have gone out of your way to visit this site, I offer my sincere condolences and shallow regrets, along with a welcome of sorts.

# About This Site
This is a development blog. I mainly intend to share knowledge related to IT development, but since things in life rarely go as planned, many non-development topics will be posted as well. In other words, while it is ostensibly a "development blog," I also occasionally write down random thoughts or nonsense.
Instead of using a blog CMS or service, I am extending and sharing my note-taking app. Therefore, while I may write "how-to" articles, I plan to focus on writing about concepts, much like a wiki site.

# Miscellaneous
This site can also be accessed at [jujin.dev](https://juijn.dev).
Contact is generally welcome. You can find my contact information on [GitHub](https://github.com/jujinkim) or [my main site](https://jujin.kim).
