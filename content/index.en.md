# Welcome
To those of you who have bothered to visit this site, I offer my deepest condolences along with a touch of regret, while also trying my best to welcome you.

# About This Site
This is a development blog. I mainly intend to share knowledge related to IT development, but as things in life don't always go as planned, many non-development related topics will also be posted. In other words, while it is ostensibly a "development blog," I also occasionally write down my thoughts or nonsense that isn't about development.
Instead of using a blog CMS or service, I am sharing by extending a note-taking app. Therefore, although I will write posts like "How to ~," I plan to focus on writing about the concepts of things whenever possible, much like a Wiki site.

# Miscellaneous
