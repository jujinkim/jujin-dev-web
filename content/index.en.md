# Welcome
This is my development blog. I might post things other than development as well.

# About this site
Ostensibly, it's a "development blog," but I also occasionally write down my thoughts/nonsense that aren't related to development.
Instead of using a blog CMS or service, this is a site that extends a note-taking app for sharing. Therefore, I plan to write articles focusing on the concepts of things, rather than "how-to" guides. Like a Wiki site.

# Etc.
This site can also be accessed at [jujin.dev](https://juijn.dev).
I welcome most contact. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/jujinkim) or contact me through the contact information on [my main site](https://jujin.kim).
